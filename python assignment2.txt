1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
   The two values of Boolean data type are True and False .First alphabet of both the values    must be capital i.e.True ,False.
   
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
   The three different types of Boolean operators are:
   AND
   OR
   NOT
   
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
   Truth Tables for boolean operators:
   AND-
   True  AND True  = True
   True  AND False = False
   False AND True  = False
   False AND False = False
   
   OR-
   True  OR True  = True
   True  OR False = True
   False OR True  = True
   False OR False = False
   
   NOT
   NOT True  = False
   NOT False = True


4. What are the values of the following expressions?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                  :False
not (5 > 4)                           :False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                   :True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))             :False
(True and True) and (True == False)   :False
(not False) or (not True)             :True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
   Six comparison operators:

   == (equal to)
   != (not equal to)
   > (greater than)
   < (less than)
   >= (greater than or equal to)
   <= (less than or equal to)
   
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
   The equal to operator (==) is used for comparison, while the assignment operator (=) is       used to assign a value to a variable.
    EXAMPLE- x = 5  # Assignment
             x == 5:  # Comparison
    

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

  BLOCK 1-
     spam = 0
  BLOCK 2-
     if spam == 10:
     print('eggs')
  BLOCK 3-
     if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
     else:
        print('ham')
        print('spam')
        print('spam')


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
  code is-
      spam = 1
      if spam == 1:
          print('Hello')
      elif spam == 2:
          print('Howdy')
      else:
          print('Greetings!')


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
  To interrupt an endless loop, you can press Ctrl+C on the keyboard.
   
   
10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
    The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, while the continue statement is     used to skip the rest of the code inside the loop and move to the next iteration.
    
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10,     1)?
    In a for loop:
    range(10) goes from 0 to 9.
    range(0, 10) also goes from 0 to 9.
    range(0, 10, 1) specifies a step of 1, so it goes from 0 to 9.
    
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
   FOR LOOP-
   for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
   WHILE LOOP-
   i = 1
   while i <= 10:
   print(i)
   i += 1
   
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
   import spam
   spam.bacon()
